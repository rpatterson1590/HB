       <p>
        I love this time of year!!! Our God is so unique, and wonderful. He shows us how He thought of everything, in creating the world we live in, to see it & to be enjoyed!! We have four seasons each year, andeather is olerent, and has its purpose.<br>
       </p>
       <p>
        Here we are in the FALL season. The weather is cooler and the trees leaves are changing into beautiful orange, yellow, red, & brown colors. They are so beautiful, and it is amazing to see how each tree is placed with its own color, with other trees of different colors! What beauty to behold with our eyes everywhere we go! God Did That!!!<br>
</p>
<p>
        Each tree knows when it is the FALL season for their leaves to change from being all green, to different colors. We only are given a short time to enjoy all the fall colors, before the leaves (not the trees) die, and turn brown and fall off. WHAT A TOTAL DIFFERENT CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THIS PROCESS. Those trees that we once looked at having so much beauty, and color, have become looking empty and dead.<br>
</p>
<p>
       The trees look like they will never be beautiful again. The trees are not giving up to show what will happen in a different season, because they are grounded and rooted to survive the hard times they are about face during the next season in life. God has created you to be beautiful and unique in your life. You will face seasons of change and if YOU are grounded and rooted in God's Word YOU will survive the storms and changes in life!<br>
   </p>
   <p>    
       In All Our Lives We Experience Seasons Of Happiness, Seasons Of Sadness, Seasons Of Peace, and Seasons Of Discomfort. Different circumstances, and people, and choices we make brings these different seasons on in each of our lives.<br>
</p>
<p>
       As YOU face your season in life, just remember to stay close to God Your Father by reading and obeying His Word. He will heal you from all that looked like it was going to destroy you, and You will experience a change take place. Never forget that YOU have Jesus Christ As Your Lord and Savior and You Are Connected To Him Like A Vine To The Branch!<br>
</p>
<p>
       READ: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015&version=KJV">St. John Chapter 15 Today!</a> It Tells Us To Abide In Jesus (Be Connected) Like A Vine Is To A Branch and Good Things Will Happen In Our Lives!
