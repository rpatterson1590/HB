       <h3>HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!</h3>
       
<p>It is a brand NEW YEAR and we can start over and bring this year into greatness and be proud of what we do to draw closer to God and Family!!!</p>



<quote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208%3A17&version=KJV">Proverbs 8:17</a> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me<quote>

<p>"God is wanting us to have a relationship with Him, and in order to do that, you will seek Him diligently! Take time daily to read God's Word and pray! Take time to praise Him for all His goodness on your life! Reach out and share the love of God with others by witnessing and doing good deeds for others. Help and care for the widows, orphans, and needy. Whatever you do, reach out to those as if it was Jesus you were blessing and caring for. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025%3A35-40&version=KJV">Matthew 25:35-40</a></p>

<p>Make time for YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS! Life is so short, and it is definitely passing us by so quickly. YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF YOUR OWN LIFE STORY! To make memories that will last a lifetime, while you are alive and after you leave this world, will only happen by you making time to spend with your family now! Fire a fire pit up and grill hot dogs or grill hamburgers, and plan game nights, and laugh, and enjoy FAMILY TIME!!! Plan family time not only on holidays, but anytime you can enjoy doing something together! Talk about your childhood memories and let your family talk about their best childhood memories. Make new ones and tell them how important they are to you, and you will take more time and make more effort to be around for them to enjoy life together with you. Tell your children and grandchildren how important it would be to you to have them go to church with you, and plan a Sunday at least once a month (if not more) for you all to be in church together. Let YOUR FAMILY always see and remember the love you have for God and how important He is to you!!!! NEVER FORGET, HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE IS WHAT FAMILY & OTHERS WILL ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WHEN YOUR NAME IS MENTIONED, & ALSO WHAT THEY WILL REMEMBER ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU LEAVE THIS WORLD!!!</p>

<p class="Pastorsig">HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!! Love you all,<br>—Pastor Debbie</p>
