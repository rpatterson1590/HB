      with eye contact and even a hug!!!!	This is a precious gift and the best medicine anyone can receive!!!	Make sure to put your love in action, by spending time to communicate with that 
      love one and if you listen closely, you might find out there is something you can do to help them have a better day!!!<strong>IT IS FIND LOVE IS GIVEN BACK GREATLY!!!</strong> That Is Why God
