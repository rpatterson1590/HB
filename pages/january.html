    We still want to experience and have a human being to love us everyday of our lives!	Nothing can bring you more joy than to feel you are loved!!!	I cannot explain in words how important it is for you to NEVER STOP telling your parents, your
   children, your grandchildren, your spouses, other family members, your dearest friends, & your church family <strong>YOU LOVE THEM!!!</strong> Make sure to tell them often!!!!!	This needs to come
      with eye contact and even a hug!!!!	This is a precious gift and the best medicine anyone can receive!!!	Make sure to put your love in action, by spending time to communicate with that 
      love one and if you listen closely, you might find out there is something you can do to help them have a better day!!!<strong>IT IS FIND LOVE IS GIVEN BACK GREATLY!!!</strong> That Is Why God
      Created Us To Experience Love For <strong>GOD IS LOVE!!!!</strong>	Read:<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A8&version=KJV">1 JOHN 4:8.</a>
