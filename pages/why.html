    <h2>Why Heaven Bound Church of God?</h2>

    <p><strong>“Where Everybody is Somebody!”</strong></p>

    <p>At Heaven Bound Church of God, we believe that every soul matters to God — and every person who walks through our doors is seen, known, and loved. Our church is not just a building, it’s a family rooted in faith, hope, and love.</p>

    <h3>What Makes Us Different?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>💒 A Church Where You're Known</strong><br>
        We don't just welcome you — we want to know your name, your story, and your place in our spiritual family.</li>

      <li><strong>📖 Bible-Centered Preaching</strong><br>
        Every message is grounded in God’s Word. We don’t water down the truth — we proclaim the Gospel with clarity and conviction.</li>

      <li><strong>🙏 Spirit-Led Worship</strong><br>
        Our services are filled with heartfelt worship, prayer, and the presence of God. Whether it’s Sunday morning or midweek revival, we gather to meet with Jesus.</li>

      <li><strong>🛐 Led by Servants of God</strong><br>
        Our pastors and leaders are called, anointed, and committed to loving God's people with humility, strength, and compassion.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We’re not trying to be like the world. We’re trying to be like Jesus. If you’re looking for a place where the Word is preached, the Spirit is moving, and people love each other like family — then you just might be Heaven Bound.</p>

    <p><em>Come join us — because here, everybody truly is somebody.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Galatians 3:28</strong> — "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."</p>
