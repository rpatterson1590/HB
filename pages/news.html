          <h3>✝️From the Pastor’s Desk✝️</h3>
          <p>
           Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A10&version=KJV">ST. JOHN 10:10</a> “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”
The thief is the devil, satan. He will try to take everything and anything that belongs to you! Abundantly, that’s living life to the fullest every day through Christ and having more than enough! That is called blessings!

          
          <p>
            <strong>PLEASE STAY CLOSE TO JESUS BY KEEPING HIM IN YOUR HEARTS AT ALL TIMES!</strong> You are safe if you are keeping Him in your hearts. If you are not keeping Him in your heart every day you are in danger of backsliding. Please do not let the devil deceive you!!! The devil wants you to serve him. The Spirit of God will bring a warning. That is what He is doing to you from a happy life to a sad one. The Christian will backslide if they do not pray and fast, read their Bible, attend church, and live right for God.
          </p>


        <p>
         We must always be wise as God’s children. We must also be wise in dealing with our problems and backslidden people. Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. The enemy is hoping the Christian will blame God for their problems and backslide. He is hoping the Christian will destroy spiritually, mentally, physically, and financially. 
        </p>

<blockquote>But Jesus said: “I AM COME THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE LIFE, AND THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE IT MORE ABUNDANTLY.”</blockquote>

<p>Jesus gives us a life of peace, love, blessings & happiness. Jesus is our Healer!!! Don’t ever forget where our help comes from!!! Everyone be blessed! Please obey God’s Word daily and be blessed!!! I love you all!!!</p>

<h2>🕊️A Note from Mrs. Jannette White🕊️</h2>

<p>In January of this year, we began our Golden Harmony Event at church. It started in the fellowship hall. This is a monthly fellowship for anyone 65 and above. We meet in Heaven Bound’s fellowship hall on the first Tuesday of each month. We have a devotional at 10:30 AM, a guest speaker, singing, lunch, fun games to win, and prizes. Sometimes gifts. Then a game of Bingo with winners receiving gifts. We always enjoy ourselves and the fellowship.</p>

<p>Golden Harmony is a great time for fellowship and worship. We have had 8 meetings this year. Thank you, Lord, for what He is doing for us. In September we celebrated our 8th Golden Harmony Event.</p>

<p>Please don’t forget about our Golden Harmony Event every first Tuesday of each month at 10 A.M. Hope to see you!</p>

<p>God bless you all,</p>
