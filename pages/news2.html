    <p><span class="deck">What began as a usual chapel program last week at Heard County High School turned into a revival that lasted over five hours.</span></p>

    <p>The Tri‑Hi‑Y Club at Heard High sponsored an “I Love Jesus Week” in which students gathered voluntarily in the gymnasium for a 30‑minute chapel program.</p>

    <p>The Rev. <strong>Gary Parrish</strong>, pastor of the <strong>Franklin United Methodist Church</strong>, delivered a short sermonette and several hymns were sung.</p>

    <p>The program then allowed personal testimony from students and faculty.</p>

    <p>The line of students and faculty members waiting to give personal testimony continuously grew longer and the chapel program continued.</p>

    <p>Some of the students and faculty chose to give testimony in song.</p>

    <p>The service continued through lunch and during the afternoon, when almost all of the student body reconvened in the gym to listen and share their personal testimony.</p>

    <p>Many of the participants went forward from their gymnasium seats to kneel for prayer.</p>

    <p>A number of the students rededicated their lives to Christ, and many made a personal commitment for the first time.</p>

    <p><strong>Don Staples</strong>, principal of the school, said the services were “almost unbelievable. I’ve never seen anything to compare with it.”</p>

    <p>The <strong>Rev. Parrish</strong> said, “The revival that broke out is something one reads about happening long ago or somewhere else, but the students and faculty of Heard County High School can witness to the fact that it happened in their school.”</p>

    <p>He added that in days when many across the country are protesting and picketing, it is encouraging to see the students of Heard County praising God instead.</p>

    <p>Similar services continued throughout the week during the lunch period and also conducted this week.</p>
