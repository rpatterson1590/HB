      <p>God spoke to my heart a word for Heaven Bound Church of God and it was:</p>
      <blockquote>
       “If God is for us, who can be against us."<br>—Romans 8:31 
      </blockquote>

      <p>He reminded me of His word that was declared by the prophet Haggai.</p>
      <blockquote>“For the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of Hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of Hosts.”<br>— Haggai 2:9</blockquote>
   
<p>Saints, the best is yet to come! God has a plan to bless us with His peace and His glory. His word cannot lie!</p>

<p>We are moving forward as a church family to better things. We’ve experienced what God has planned for you as individuals, as a child of God.
We love this season of change and newness. A time to reflect on the beautiful goodness of what He has planted in your life. Don’t forget to praise God for all His goodness in your life!</p>

<p class="Pastorsig">Love you all,<br>—Pastor Debbie</p>

      <p>In January of this year we began our Children’s Church. We started in the Book of Genesis: The Beginning — we’re created by God! We learned “God made us in His image, and He loves us.”
For this September our children will be working toward the Christmas Program and The Candy Connection!
We’ll continue Children’s Church on Sundays moving forward to Genesis 12.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about our Children’s Ministry, contact me.
Please don’t forget about our Golden Harmony event! It’s the 4th Tuesday of each month at 10 A.M.</p>
